# ViMO
Visualizer for Meta-Omics (ViMO) is an interactive R-Shiny-based application to facilitate the data integration between metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics. At the same time ViMO aims to provide the user with interactive, publication-ready, and relevant graphical representations of the data.

**ViMO can be accessed online here: https://magnusarntzen.shinyapps.io/VisualizerForMultiOmics/**

**ViMO integrate data from**  
  -metagenomics  
  -metatranscriptomics  
  -metaproteomics  
  -taxonomy  
  -quality measures  
  -KEGG functions and module completion  
  -Carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes)  

**ViMO makes plots of:**  
  -MAG quality  
  -MAG abundance in various files  
  -CAZyme categories in various MAGs and their abundancies at transcript- and protein-level  
  -KEGG categories in various MAGs and their abundancies at transcript- and protein-level  
  -KEGG module completion fractions to see the metabolic potential for each MAG
