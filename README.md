# ViMO
Visualizer for Meta-Omics (ViMO) is an interactive R-Shiny-based application to facilitate the data integration between metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics. At the same time ViMO aims to provide the user with interactive, publication-ready, and relevant graphical representations of the data.

**ViMO can be accessed online here:**

### ViMO integrate data from
  - Metagenomics  
  - Metatranscriptomics  
  - Metaproteomics  
  - Taxonomy  
  - Quality measures  
  - KEGG functions and module completion  
  - Carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes)  

### ViMO makes plots of:
  - MAG quality  
  - MAG abundance in various files  
  - CAZyme categories in various MAGs and their abundancies at transcript- and protein-level  
  - KEGG categories in various MAGs and their abundancies at transcript- and protein-level  
  - KEGG module completion fractions to see the metabolic potential for each MAG
