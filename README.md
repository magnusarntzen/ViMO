# ViMO
Visualizer for Meta-Omics (ViMO) is an interactive R-Shiny-based application to facilitate the data integration between metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics. At the same time ViMO aims to provide the user with interactive, publication-ready, and relevant graphical representations of the data.
